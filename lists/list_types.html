	<p> See me walking down Fifth Avenue, walking cane here at my side. Take it everywhere I walk, i'm an English man in New York.<br> One fine day in the middle of the night, two dead men got up to fight. Back-to-back they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each other! Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after! Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the kings horses and all the kings men, couldn't put humpty together again!</p>
	<p> There is a fountain filled with blood, drawn from Emmanuel's vein. And sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain. :ose all their guilty stain, lose all their guilty stain. And sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain!
		<div> There's a call come ringing o'er the restless waves. Send the light! Send the light! There are souls to be rescued, there are souls to be saved. Send the light! Send the light! Send the light! The blessed gospel light. Let it shine from shore to shore. Send the light! The blessed gospel light. Let it shine for evermore!

	<p> This is the third paragraph and i am writing this to filled the page so that the section 1 link is placed further down the page. I will then be able to see if the link will bring you top near the top of the page where section one is situated. I have just notice that I now have two h1 tags. I am not ure if I can just change this and save as I have already pushed this to the website repository. I will have a think and then decide what to do.
