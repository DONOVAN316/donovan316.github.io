	<p> See me walking down Fifth Avenue, walking cane here at my side. Take it everywhere I walk, i'm an English man in New York.<br> One fine day in the middle of the night, two dead men got up to fight. Back-to-back they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each other! Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after! Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the kings horses and all the kings men, couldn't put humpty together again!</p>
	<p> There is a fountain filled with blood, drawn from Emmanuel's vein. And sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain. :ose all their guilty stain, lose all their guilty stain. And sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain!
		<div> There's a call come ringing o'er the restless waves. Send the light! Send the light! There are souls to be rescued, there are souls to be saved. Send the light! Send the light! Send the light! The blessed gospel light. Let it shine from shore to shore. Send the light! The blessed gospel light. Let it shine for evermore!

	<p> This is the third paragraph and i am writing this to filled the page so that the section 1 link is placed further down the page. I will then be able to see if the link will bring you top near the top of the page where section one is situated. I have just notice that I now have two h1 tags. I am not ure if I can just change this and save as I have already pushed this to the website repository. I will have a think and then decide what to do.
	</p>
	<p> I have just found out that the section 1 link has still not been pushed down the page far enough to test whether clicking the link will make the page shift up to section 1 which is near the top of the page so I will just keep writing so that it can be checked. I will also take this opportunity to get rid of the duplicate h1 tag. I will remove the one around the ORDERED LIST and replace this with a section tag instead.

I am currently learning html and am finding it to be quite really good. It is much easier than I thought it would be and I think the course I have just started on Coursera if very good. As well as html, the course is going to cover CSS and javascript so, by the end, I should be able to create some great content with pleasing, interactive visuals. This is just the tsart of the journey for me and I want to see how far I can take it. For m, it is important that we should get new skilld that will help us in todays modern world. There might be lots more things that will help us to make out lives better, easy and get the jobs we need to do faster. So I don't think I wikk stop there. There must be some other technology type stuff that is really fun to learn and will help me keep up with new technology because our jobs may change and we need to be able to adapt in order to keep up or, more importantly, to advance to a higher level
